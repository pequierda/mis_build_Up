# Upstash CLI Commands for Admin Setup
# Copy and paste these commands one by one in your Upstash CLI

# IMPORTANT: Make sure you set the VALUES, not the key names!

# 1. Set admin username (the VALUE should be "admin")
SET admin:username "admin"

# 2. Set admin password (the VALUE should be "admin123")
SET admin:password "admin123"

# 3. Verify the credentials were set correctly
# These should return "admin" and "admin123", NOT "admin:username" and "admin:password"
GET admin:username
GET admin:password

# 4. Test the connection
GET test:connection

# 5. Check if services list exists (should be empty initially)
GET services_list

# 6. List all keys to verify everything is set up
KEYS *

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# If GET admin:username returns "admin:username" instead of "admin",
# you set the key name as the value. Run these commands again:
# SET admin:username "admin"
# SET admin:password "admin123"
